  "The purpose of life is to contribute in some way to making things better" - Robert F. Kennedy
</p>

I'm an electrical engineer turned self-taught web developer. I want to use technology to build tools and make everyone's life better. I value and interested in open education (and owe it for what I know), human and computer languages and well documented code.

Most recently I was a telecommunications consultant working for Vodafone, Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens. I'm currently based in sunny Newcastle (Australia) but previously lived and worked in Madrid (Spain) and St.Petersburg (Russia).

When I'm not learning another fancy front-end tool/framework/new language I'm answering my toddlers' questions, [reading](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/20IXRZL8G8FWL/ref=cm_wl_list_o_2?), listening to music or busy with some sort of home renovation project.

The easiest way to contact me is by <a href="mailto:z.a.astafyeva@gmail.com">e-mail</a>
